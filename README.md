C++ Full Winapi Project

Welcome to this section!! Thanks for taking the time to read this.
In this project i learned to use Winapi properly, using structures, Winapi functions, Callbacks, lists(doubly liked),and
more accurate knowledge of C++

The main Project it's like a system, in which workers and users are gonna register to operate in the business.
The information is saved in .bin files and in .txt files.

Even though Nobody uses winapi in 2022, i still feel it's important in order to develop more than a console aplication in C++.
Imagine your brother who has a business, asks you to develop someting small in C++, with Winapi, now you have the option to convert 
your console app to a interface app.
